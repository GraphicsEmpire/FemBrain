List of features to be added:

1. Unified scenegraph data structure for all geometries.

	Graphics:
		a. Implicit Surfaces
		b. Mesh-based surfaces (Subdivision and others.)
		c. NURBS
		d. Bicubic and bilinear bezier patches
		e. Affine Transformations and other animations
		f. Custom shading programs embedded
		
	Physics:
		a. Tetrahedralization
		b. Voxelization
		c. Veg exporter/importer
		d. Material editor
		
2. OpenCL raytracing for scenegraph
3. Sketch Machine singleton that responds to commands for affine transformations and 
scenegraph incremental building modifications.
	Features:
		a. Scriptable language for building hierarchical structures based on scenegraph
		b. Custom shaders 
		c. Support for Rendering methods: 
			* Rasterization with fast VBO, FBO
			* Polygonization using OpenCL polygonizer
			* Raytracer using OpenCL raytracer
